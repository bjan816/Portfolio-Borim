                        Hello! I'm Borim, a passionate Computer Science major from Korea, currently on my final year at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. My journey through the realms of technology has equipped me with a robust foundation in programming, and a keen interest in developing solutions that bridge the gap between complex code and user-friendly experiences. As I navigate the final semester of my degree, I'm eager to translate my academic learnings into innovative projects that resonate with the pulse of the industry. Welcome to my portfolio â€“ a digital tapestry of my skills, projects, and the continuous pursuit of technological excellence.
